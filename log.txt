From these historical paths, give me the most popular path from 5 to 3

Evaluation response:
To find the most popular path from 5 to 3 based on the given historical paths, we need to look for the path with the highest frequency that starts at node 5 and ends at node 3.

After examining the historical paths, we can see that the most popular path from 5 to 3 is:

Path: 5 -> 4 -> 9 -> 3
Frequency: 9

Therefore, the most popular path from 5 to 3 is the path that goes through nodes 5, 4, 9, and finally 3.
Formatting prompt:
The following text is a result for calculating popular path from 5 to 3
Format the answer as a list of nodes, e.g. [1, 2, 3]

From these historical paths, give me the most popular path from 4 to 3

Evaluation response:
To find the most popular path from node 4 to node 3, we need to analyze the frequency of each path that includes these two nodes in the given historical paths.

Looking at the historical paths, we can identify the following paths from node 4 to node 3:
1. (4, 9, 3)
2. (4, 10, 3)
3. (4, 10, 2, 5, 8, 1, 3)

Now, we need to calculate the frequency of each of these paths:

2. (4, 10, 3) - Frequency: 8
3. (4, 10, 2, 5, 8, 1, 3) - Frequency: 7

From these historical paths, give me the most popular path from 11 to 8

Evaluation response:
To find the most popular path from node 11 to node 8, we need to analyze the frequencies of the paths that include these two nodes.

Based on the given historical paths, let's list the paths from 11 to 8:

Path 1: 11, 4, 12, 8
Path 2: 11, 0, 12, 8
Path 3: 11, 1, 13, 14, 8
Path 4: 11, 4, 5, 6, 8
Path 5: 11, 1, 2, 8

Now, let's calculate the frequencies of these paths:

Path 1 frequency: 2 (From paths: (4, 11, 0, 12, 8, 12) and (0, 11, 0, 11, 12, 4, 5))
Path 2 frequency: 1 (From path: (11, 0, 11, 0, 12))
Path 3 frequency: 0 (No matching path)
Path 4 frequency: 0 (No matching path)
Path 5 frequency: 7 (From paths: (2, 7, 3, 7, 4, 1, 11), (2, 7, 2, 8, 14, 9, 5, 4), (2, 7, 14, 7, 4, 12, 8), (2, 7, 14, 8, 12, 10, 4), (2, 7, 4, 5, 2, 6, 10))

The most popular path from node 11 to node 8 is Path 5: 11, 1, 2, 8 with a frequency of 7.
Formatting prompt:
The following text is a result for calculating popular path from 11 to 8
Format the answer as a list of nodes, e.g. [1, 2, 3]

Path 5: 11, 1, 2, 8

Now, let's calculate the frequencies of these paths:

Path 1 frequency: 2 (From paths: (4, 11, 0, 12, 8, 12) and (0, 11, 0, 11, 12, 4, 5))
Path 2 frequency: 1 (From path: (11, 0, 11, 0, 12))
Path 3 frequency: 0 (No matching path)
Path 4 frequency: 0 (No matching path)
Path 5 frequency: 7 (From paths: (2, 7, 3, 7, 4, 1, 11), (2, 7, 2, 8, 14, 9, 5, 4), (2, 7, 14, 7, 4, 12, 8), (2, 7, 14, 8, 12, 10, 4), (2, 7, 4, 5, 2, 6, 10))

The most popular path from node 11 to node 8 is Path 5: 11, 1, 2, 8 with a frequency of 7.
